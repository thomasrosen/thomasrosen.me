That’s why I created Queer Resources, a website that brings together valuable information for the queer community and allies.\n\nThe idea for Queer Resources came to me while developing the QueerMap, a project aimed at identifying queer-friendly places worldwide, particularly for queer youth. During the development process, I realized that there were already many excellent websites and resources available. However, these resources were scattered, making it challenging for users to find the information they needed. As a result, I decided to compile these links into one searchable database, making it easier for users to access the information they need.\n\nQueer Resources contains over 60 links covering various topics such as events, health, news, historical knowledge, places, trans, gay groups, and youth. Users can filter the links by location and tags, making it easier to find relevant resources.\n\nThe source code, along with all resources, can be found in the GitHub repository at github.com/thomasrosen/queer. These resources file is available for download as JSON, making the data easily accessible and usable.\n\nAlthough Queer Resources is a relatively small project, it provides a useful collection of resources for the queer community and allies. As an ally, you are also welcome to use the website to learn more about the queer community and the resources available to support us. If you know of any valuable resources that you think would be helpful to others, please feel free to email me at queer@thomasrosen.me, and I’ll add them to the database.\n\nVisit the website at queer.thomasrosen.me to access these resources and learn more about the queer community.\n","md":"\nAs a member of the queer community, I understand how challenging it can be to find reliable resources that cater to our unique needs.
