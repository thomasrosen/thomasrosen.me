A few years ago, I discovered this website with flat wallpapers. This was probably at the beginning of the flat design trend.

With my interest in creative stuff and some free hours in school, I drew two wallpapers myself to share them on the website.

You can download the [Dandelion](http://simpledesktops.com/browse/desktops/2014/jul/23/dandelion/) and [Diamond Heart](http://simpledesktops.com/browse/desktops/2014/may/27/diamond-heart/) wallpapers on [simpledesktops.com](http://simpledesktops.com/) or click on the images at the end of the article.

I enjoyed creating pictures just for the joy if it. Nobody forced me to do it and I didn’t have a real benefit from it. I have no idea how many ppl downloaded the images. It was a small website, so nobody really saw it.
But I am proud of them.

About that time, I read about decluttering the desktop to have a more focused workspace. (This probably holds true for the computer and my desk.)
Keeping my desk tidy is still hard. But over the years I changed my digital desktop to only be a black square. Black wallpaper, [automatically hidden menu bar](https://www.wikihow.com/Hide-the-Menu-Bar-on-a-Mac), [less menu bar items](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066) and [hidden desktop icons](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hiddenme-free-hide-desktop-icons/id467040476).

So pure focus … I guess …
