We visited Switzerland and Austria. We climbed the Rocky Mountains. And went to the Everest in Nepal.</p>\n<p>Journeys with other friends were warmer. Like with June. She brought me to Egypt and showed me pyramids, I couldn’t imagine the size of before.</p>\n<p>My last stay was with Noah. With him, I visited New York. I sat on a bench in Bryant Park and looked at all the people coming down from the library steps.</p>\n<p>I saw a lot in my life. For every place I have a stamp on my back. But now, I mostly live in the attic. I’m old now, sadly not good enough for another journey.</p>\n<p>But I still get new memories.<br />\nThe grandchildren sometimes visit me. They give photos of the places the enjoyed their life in. And they open me and wonder about the places I’ve seen.</p>\n<p>I’m Susan. An old suitcase with stamps on its back.</p>"}}
